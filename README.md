# Web Rich Text Editor - How to integrate a control into an MVC application

## Requirements
* To use the RichEdit control in an ASP.NET MVC application, you need to have a [Universal, DXperience, or ASP.NET subscription](https://www.devexpress.com/buy/net/).
* Versions of the devexpress npm packages should be identical (their major and minor versions should be the same).

This example illustrates a possible way of integrating the client Rich Text Editor into an MVC application using steps from the following help topic: [Rich Text Editor > Get Started > MVC Application](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/401873/rich-edit/get-started/mvc-application).
